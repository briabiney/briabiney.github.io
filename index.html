    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p> Our model had 3 buckets in them that were each connected by a tube. The first one connected straight to the bucket. The bucket also had two tubes. One connected to one  bucket and one connected to the other bottom bucket. One of the botoom</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Initially we tested the data by putting 500ml of water into the black box. The first time, nothing came out the the next few times, less came out. </p>
    <h2>Reasoning, Part 1<h2> A model is a three dimensional representation which is typically on a smaller scale, of something else.
 
<h3>Reasoning, Part 2<h2> My evidence supports my claim because if the data from the water we poured in was the same as what came out, it wouldnâ€™t be like the black blox.
